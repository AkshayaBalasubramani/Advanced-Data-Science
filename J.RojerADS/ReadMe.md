# Quantum Tunnel Tweets 

The data set contains tweets sourced from [@quantum\_tunnel](https://twitter.com/quantum_tunnel) and [@dt\_science](https://twitter.com/dt_science) as a demo for classifying text using Naive Bayes. The demo is detailed in the book _Data Science and Analytics with Python_ by Dr J Rogel-Salazar. 

Data contents:

1. **Train\_QuantumTunnel\_Tweets.csv**: Labelled tweets for text related to "Data Science" with three features:
	- DataScience: [0/1] indicating whether the text is about "Data Science" or not. 
	- Date: Date when the tweet was published
